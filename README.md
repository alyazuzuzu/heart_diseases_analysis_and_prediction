# Heart diseases analysis and prediction project.
Heart diseases is the leading cause of death in the world. In this project, I tried to analyze and made a model to predict whether the person is going to have heart diseases or not. The model was built using Logistic Regression and Random Forest. For the model evaluation, I used classification report and confusion matrix. The Random Forest model works better than the Logistic Regression one with 99% accuracy and better confusion matrix.
